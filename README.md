# hashfes
A straightforward, command-line utility to display the SHA256 and MD5 hashes of a file.

MD5 is not completely recommended as a sole source of information to verify against, therefore the SHA256 is provided as well.  MD5 is just shorter to read and type.

## Usage

```
hashfes.exe (Filename)
```
## Compiling

Simply copy the repo and run ```cargo build --release```
